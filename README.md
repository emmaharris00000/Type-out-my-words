# Type-out-my-words
Program used to type a pre-determined input into the terminal, pausing after each letter, and pausing longer after each sentence. Useful for giving screencaps subtitles

Note: Each sentence you enter must be an item, sepatated with "", in order to pause after each sentence
Note: I am using python 3, and you will need this to use this application.
