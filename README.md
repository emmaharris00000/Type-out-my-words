# Type-out-my-words
Program used to type a pre-determined input into the terminal, pausing after each letter, and pausing longer after each sentence. Useful for giving screencapture software animated subtitles, and delivering speaches when you dont want to.

Note: Each sentence you enter must be an object, sepatated with "", in order to pause after each sentence
Note: I am using Python 3, and you will need Python3 to use this application.
